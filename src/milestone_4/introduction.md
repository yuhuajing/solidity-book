# Multi-Pool Swaps

After implementing cross-tick swaps, we've got close to real Uniswap V3 swaps. One significant limitation of our implementation is that it allows only swaps within a pool–if there's no pool for a pair of tokens, then swapping between these tokens is not possible. This is not so in Uniswap since it allows multi-pool swaps. In this chapter, we're going to add multi-pool swaps to our implementation.

Here's the plan:

1. first, we'll learn about and implement the Factory contract;
1. then, we'll see how chained or multi-pool swaps work and implement the Path library;
1. then, we'll update the front-end app to support multi-pool swaps;
1. we'll implement a basic router that finds a path between two tokens;
1. along the way, we'll also learn about tick spacing which is a way of optimizing swaps.


After finishing this chapter, our implementation will be able to handle multi-pool swaps, for example, swapping WBTC for WETH via different stablecoins: WETH → USDC → USDT → WBTC.
