# Cross-Tick Swaps

We have made great progress so far and our Uniswap V3 implementation is quite close to the original one! However, our implementation only supports swaps within a price rangeâ€“and this is what we're going to improve in this milestone.

In this milestone, we'll:
1. update the `mint` function to provide liquidity in different price ranges;
1. update the `swap` function to cross price ranges when there's not enough liquidity in the current price range;
1. learn how to calculate liquidity in smart contracts;
1. implement slippage protection in the `mint` and `swap` functions;
1. update the UI application to allow to add liquidity at different price ranges;
1. learn a little bit more about fixed-point numbers.

In this milestone, we'll complete swapping, the core functionality of Uniswap!

Let's begin!
