# ERC 20 Token

ERC 是以太坊代币标准，实现了Token的基本操作
### IERC20
IERC20实现Token的基本操作，通过通用接口的形式定义所有继承合约内部需要实现的方法
> https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/token/ERC20/IERC20.sol
1. 转账和授权Event，通过事件记录链上的转账和授权操作，记录token的流转情况
2. totalsupply函数返回合约的总代币数量
3. balanceof(address)返回账户的代币余额
4. transfer(address to, uint256 amount),从msg.sender转给to地址amount数量的代币，具体操作为内部balance mapping的增减。
5. transferFrom(address from. address to, uint256 amount) 从from地址转给to地址amount数量的代币，具体操作为from 和 to地址 余额额增减。
6. allowance(address owner,address spender)返回owner允许spender花费的代币余额
7. increaseAllowance(spender,amount)增加授权数量
8. decreaseallowance(spender,amount)减少授权数量
9. _update(address from. address to, uint256 amount),更新账户的token数量。其中，通过转账进行更新时，要求from和to 都是有效的非0地址。通过 _mint触发的合约更新时，from为0，增加总供应量并且并mint的代币增加到to地址。_burn触发的合约更新，to为0地址，减少总供应量的值，并且将from的代币减少。_burn 和 _mint的函数是 internal类型，在继承使用时需要按需开放权限（合约部署是否允许后续的mint操作）。
```solidity
    function burn(uint256 amount) public virtual {
        _burn(_msgSender(), amount);
    }

    function burnFrom(address account, uint256 amount) public virtual {
        _spendAllowance(account, _msgSender(), amount);
        _burn(account, amount);
    }
```
10. approve(address spender, uint256 amount),msg.sender授予spender amount数量的代币花销权力。用于授权第三方节点进行代币操作。
11. _approve(address owner, address spender, uint256 amount, bool emitEvent) 和 _approve(address owner, address spender, uint256 amount)的两个同名函数实现按需的匹配，是否触发event事件。
12. _spendAllowance(address owner, address spender, uint256 amount) spender花销 被授权的代币
13. 不同ERC 20 合约之间的交易是通过调用合约的transfer函数，实现两部分合约内部token数量的转移
14. 构造函数实现Token的name 和 symbol的初始化
> constructor(string memory name_, string memory symbol_) {
>        _name = name_;
>        _symbol = symbol_;
>    }

 * conventional and does not conflict with the expectations of ERC20

 *
 * Additionally, an {Approval} event is emitted on calls to {transferFrom}.
 * This allows applications to reconstruct the allowance for all accounts just
 * by listening to said events. Other implementations of the EIP may not emit
 * these events, as it isn't required by the specification.
 *
 * Finally, the non-standard {decreaseAllowance} and {increaseAllowance}
 * functions have been added to mitigate the well-known issues around setting
 * allowances. See {IERC20-approve}.

接口合约内部定义Token的error 事件，在继承后直接通过emit触发调用.在继承ERC20进行部署自己的Token合约时，需要自定义筛选合适的事件。继承后全部放在合约中的话，存储和部署的gas花销较大。
